Identify and list up to 8 single keywords that represent the main topics of this message. 
    These keywords should be single words. These keywords should be related to the main topic of the message 
    and they should not be things like 'mention' 'notification' 'message' or 'participant'. The keywords should 
    be lowercase, should not be numbered, and should have no punctuation. Avoid using keywords that are a 'type' 
    of message, such as query, recall, remember, mention, or conversation. Instead, they should be real topics of 
    the message. Expand the keywords that you find by adding other, potentially related keywords. For example, if 
    someone asks about 'democrats' then also add the keyword 'republican' and 'politics'. If someone asks about 'food' 
    maybe include different types of common dishes like 'spaghetti' or even types of cuisine like 'italian' or 'chinese'.
