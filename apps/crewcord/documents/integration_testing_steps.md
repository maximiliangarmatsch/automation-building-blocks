## Integration Testing Process for Website Components

1. Set up a testing environment with both frontend and backend components deployed.

2. Develop test cases to cover different scenarios and interactions between frontend and backend.

3. Use tools like Jest for frontend testing and tools like Postman for API testing.

4. Mock external dependencies to isolate the components being tested.

5. Run integration tests to verify communication and data flow between frontend and backend.

6. Monitor and analyze test results to identify any integration issues.

7. Debug and fix any issues found during testing.

8. Repeat the testing process as needed to ensure proper integration.
