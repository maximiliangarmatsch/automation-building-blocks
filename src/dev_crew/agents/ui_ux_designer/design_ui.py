            Design the user interface (UI) for the {project_description}. 
            The design should include layouts for all key pages, ensuring consistency 
            across the entire site. Focus on creating an intuitive, user-friendly interface 
            that aligns with the projectâ€™s goals and target audience.

            The task involves:
            - Creating wireframes for each page, starting from low-fidelity sketches 
              and progressing to shigh-fidelity prototypes.
            - Defining the color schemes, typography, and visual style to maintain 
              brand identity and appeal.
            - Designing key components like navigation bars, buttons, forms, and 
              interactive elements that are both functional and visually appealing.
            - Incorporating user feedback to iterate on the design and ensure 
              usability and accessibility.

            Additionally, generate a sample image of the main interface to give 
            a visual preview of the design. Before finalizing, ensure to check 
            with a human for feedback on the draft to refine the design further 
            based on real-world insights and preferences.
